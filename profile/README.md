## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I use this organiztion to section off my demos for my [website](https://jareddyreson.xyz) and uses Docker to help separate resources.

A base Ubuntu 21.04 server release is used as the primary operating system to host these instances.
At `/var/lib/webapplications` we store all the Git repositories and can pull incrementally for changes made offsite.
The goal was not make this server a development environment, rather a showcase that can be easily replicated.
A [script](https://github.com) has been developed to help automate this process.
